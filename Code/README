Code for the old implementation of fitting linear relations in 2 or 3 dimensions
with flexible choice of minimization algorithm and direction.

README           this file
iterfitlin.cl    main cl-script, this is declared and run under IRAF
random.cl        created random numbers, used for the bootstrap algorithm in iterfitlin.cl
makefile         makefile for Fortran program random which is used by random.cl
random.f         main program for random
ran1.f           Numerical recipes code for random number generation

run_iter.cl      Example of how to run iterfitlin, uses the next three FITS files
                 All our data are in FITS Tables, so would be best if the new python
                 implemenation can read FITS, otherwise we'll add that later
comafit.fits
rxj0152allfit.fits
rxj1226allfit.fits
run_iter_output.txt  Output from running run_iter.cl
